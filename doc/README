==== MateVM ====

MateVM is a Java JIT compiler written in Haskell, using already existing
libaries, namly `harpy' [1] and `hs-java' [2].

We use `hs-java' to parse Java Classfiles in order to get a Java Bytecode
representation. Afterwards we perform a basic-block analysis and generate a
control-flow-graph (CFG). We apply several program-analysis, transformations
and optimizations. Given the annotated CFG we emit native code with `harpy'
(i386) in a on demand manner.

At the moment we try to minimize effort, by focusing on essential features of
the JVM, e.g. no exception handling. 
Performance will be evaluated using a dedicated testsuite which can be handeld
in our limited implementation.

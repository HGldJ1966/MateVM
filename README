== DEPENDENCIES ==
=== HARPY ===
	$ cabal install harpy

=== HS-JAVA ===
for `hs-java' a patched build is needed:
	$ git clone git://wien.tomnetworks.com/hs-java.git
	$ git checkout v0.2
	$ cd hs-java; cabal configure; cabal build; cabal install


== NOTE ==
unfortunately, many haskell libaries arn't tested very well, so building
libraries from hackage can be a very painful trip.

a system configuration we had success building all required
libraries (yes, no x86_64 so far!):

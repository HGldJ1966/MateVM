MateVM is i686 (i.e. 32-Bit) only at the moment.

== DEPENDENCIES ==
Install GHC via your distro manager. Make sure you install it with shared
libaries. On ubuntu 12.04 LTS that is:
	$ sudo apt-get install ghc-dynamic

For an "easy" installation of the remaining packages, you can use
the script in "./tools/installhaskellenv.sh".
PLEASE NOTE: it deletes your ~/.cabal and ~/.ghc directory first in order to get
a fresh cabal install!
